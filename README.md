## üöÄ Overview

**Financial Models Compilation** is an Android app that serves as a lightweight, intuitive **wrapper for multiple Python-based Streamlit apps**, each dedicated to exploring and simulating key models in **quantitative finance**.

These apps are designed to support students, educators, and professionals in understanding complex financial concepts through **interactive, hands-on experimentation**.

## üì± How it works

This app loads a remote list of apps ‚Äî each built in **Python using Streamlit** ‚Äî and lets the user:

- Select a model from a clean list
- Launch the corresponding Streamlit app in a WebView
- Interact with sliders, plots, and simulations as originally developed

> üí° The Android app itself is minimal and serves only as a wrapper and navigation interface ‚Äî the logic and UI of each model runs via Streamlit in the cloud.

---

## üî≠ Roadmap

New models and features are planned, including:

- üßÆ Multi-factor pricing frameworks (e.g., APT)
- üìà Portfolio optimization & regression analytics
- üîê Risk-neutral valuation engines

Stay tuned ‚Äî this collection will continue to grow.
